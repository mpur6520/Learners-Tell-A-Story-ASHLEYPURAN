	<h1>A Wonderful Story Featuring a Cat (and a girl, but the cat is more important)</h1>

	<div>
		<img src="one.png">
      <p>It was a beautiful, sunny day when an unnamed cat roamed the busy city street.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
		<img src="two.png">
      <p>He was very mischievous, he enjoyed knocking over tins and chasing people.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="three.png">
      <p>One day, the cat saw a small girl sitting alone, on a bench near the city park.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="four.png">
      <p>He could see rain--or maybe they were tears-- falling from where she sat.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
		<img src="five.png">
      <p>The cat walked over to the girl, though not before hissing at a random person.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="six.png">
      <p>He jumped up on the bench next to her. The girl, startled, pays him no mind. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="seven.png">
      <p>He jumps again, gaining her attention. She turns towards him, and the cat blinks.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="eight.png">
      <p>'Oh, her eyes are raining,' he thinks. He doesn't care anymore, he wants a snack.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="nine.png">
      <p>The young girl gives the cat a piece of salmon, out of nowhere. She's smiling now.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="ten.png">
      <p>Salmon isn't his favorite. The cat will still take it. He nods in appreciation, and stares.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
		<img src="eleven.png">
      <p>He purrs in dissatisfaction--if the weather is so easy to change, why does it rain?</p>
   </div>

    <div>
		<img src="twelve.png">
      <p>The cat walks away from the girl, who's still smiling. He's off to kick some cans.</p>
    </div>
